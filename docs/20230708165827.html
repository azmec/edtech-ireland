<p>Suppose a philosopher states, “None should fear death. None know what happens
after death”. Her argument exemplifies two kinds of statements: the normative
and descriptive. The normative statement is evaluative or prescriptive in
nature—its meaning or content is found in what it implies <em>ought</em> to be done
by some norms. The descriptive statement simply presents a state of affairs
without commentary of what ought to be about such affairs. In sum, the
philosopher’s first statement, “None should fear death” is normative; her
second, “None know what happens after death”, is descriptive. The normativity
of a thing amounts to its evaluative or prescriptive character.</p>
<p>Education and the philosophical and scientific research regarding it is
normative: it is performed in light of statements characterizing what education
ought to be, what it ought to be for, and who ought to receive it. Necessarily,
such statements guide the direction and application of educational research and
development. The mathematics professor teaches because her craft is evaluated
as useful by some norm, and that education teaches “that which is useful” is
itself a norm. Normativity structures the character of scientific research
and moral inquiry: it gives force or weight to reasons. Therefore, when one
inquires of the direction and structure of education, it seems appropriate to
consider its norms. The importance is doubled for inquiries into new fields,
such as educational technology, wherein the trajectory of their growth can be
assessed and re-oriented.</p>
<p>The Republic of Ireland presents an opportunity to study the norms driving the
educational technology sector, particularly in reference to the country’s
position in the global economy as a center for technological innovation.
Throughout its brief history as an independent state, Ireland directed its
educational and economic policies towards meeting the needs of the global
economy. Further, in recent history, Ireland has been attempting to situate
itself as the site of technological research and innovation, further
entrenching itself in the global knowledge economy. The nation’s commitment to
these two goals has developed it into the global hub of technology it is today,
but the norms driving this commitment are also responsible for the current
state of Ireland’s educational technology sector. As will be discussed in the
foregoing pages, the Irish educational technology industry has its historic
roots in Ireland’s response to the global knowledge economy and has since
become implicated in the country’s drive to become a global centre for
technology and research—at the level of both educational and economic policy.</p>

<h2>Map of Content</h2>
<p>The exploration of the norms of Irish educational technology is divided into
three parts: public policy, in-industry and academic research, and private
enterprise. <em>Policy</em> surveys the history of Irish educational technology policy
and its conception of such technologies, providing an in-culture foundation on
which to evaluate projects in research and enterprise. <em>Research</em> examines
selected institutions and organizations performing educational technology
research in the Irish economy and academia, forecasting developments in the
industry. <em>Enterprise</em> surveys a select few Irish enterprises in the Irish
educational technology sector and examines them in light of the norms and
research established in <em>Policy</em>.</p>
