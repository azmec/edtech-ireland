			<h1>Irish Educational Technology</h1>
<p class="subtitle">From Policy to Enterprise</p>
<section>
<p>Suppose a philosopher states, “None should fear death. None know what happens
after death”. Her argument exemplifies two kinds of statements: the normative
and descriptive. The normative statement is evaluative or prescriptive in
nature—its meaning or content is found in what it implies <em>ought</em> to be done
by some norms. The descriptive statement simply presents a state of affairs
without commentary of what ought to be about such affairs. In sum, the
philosopher’s first statement, “None should fear death” is normative; her
second, “None know what happens after death”, is descriptive. The normativity
of a thing amounts to its evaluative or prescriptive character.</p>
<p>Education and the philosophical and scientific research regarding it is
normative: it is performed in light of statements characterizing what education
ought to be, what it ought to be for, and who ought to receive it. Necessarily,
such statements guide the direction and application of educational research and
development. The mathematics professor teaches because her craft is evaluated
as useful by some norm, and that education teaches “that which is useful” is
itself a norm. Normativity structures the character of scientific research
and moral inquiry: it gives force or weight to reasons. Therefore, when one
inquires of the direction and structure of a education and its technologies,
it seems appropriate to consider its norms.</p>
<p>Furthermore, considerations of a new field and its norms afford an opportunity
project their future trajectory and appropriately re-orient them onto new
trajectories. Such is the case for the field of educational technology: the
application of computer hardware,  software, and learning theory to educational
practice.</p>
<p>The Republic of Ireland presents the opportunity for a case-study of norms or
motivations regarding educational technology, particularly in light of its
industry and position in the European Union… This project surveys the Irish
educational industry in an attempt to demonstrate the parallel economic and
pedagogic motivations of the industry and the significance these norms have on
the sector’s research, application, and Ireland’s position in the European
Union.</p>

<h2>Review</h2>
<p>Before further discussion, indulge me. Below are a series of questions designed
to review the above content. Please, for each question, think about your
answer, note if you believe the answer to be correct, and answer truthfully as

<p>Did you remember what you have just read? Suppose you did: will you remember in
a week, month, or year from now? On average, the answer is no. However, the
above questionnaire is designed to ensure you remember the above content by
scheduling review sessions at the most optimum moments. You are notified of
these review sessions by email, so I invite you to sign up for an account. By
doing so, you make memory a choice.</p>

<h2>Map of Content</h2>
<p>The exploration of the norms of Irish educational technology is divided into
three parts: public policy, in-industry and academic research, and private
enterprise. <em>Policy</em> surveys the history of Irish educational technology policy
and its conception of such technologies, providing an in-culture foundation on
which to evaluate projects in research and enterprise. <em>Research</em> examines
selected institutions and organizations performing educational technology
research in the Irish economy and academia, forecasting developments in the
industry. <em>Enterprise</em> surveys a select few Irish enterprises in the Irish
educational technology sector and examines them in light of the norms and
research established in <em>Policy</em>.</p>
