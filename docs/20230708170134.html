<p>Ireland’s <a href="20230708171052.html">educational technology industry</a> must be considered in light of its
educational institutions. <a href="20230708170903.html">In-industry and academic research</a> is determined
by stakeholders’ answers to the historic debates of educational policy: what is
the purpose of schooling; what is the nature of learning; what are teachers’
roles? Innovation in education must and historically has struggled with these
debates.<label for="fn-Cohen1987" class="margin-toggle

</span> Similarly, Ireland’s Department of Education and Sciences (DES) has,
historically, struggled to arrive at an evaluation and conception of
educational technology aligned with educational practice and pedagogy. The DES’
construction of educational technology, throughout its history, has evolved
from a primarily economically motivated concept to one situated within existing
education theory and necessarily aligned with it.</p>
<p>In 1998, the DES published the first among a string of policies outlining the
role of educational technologies in schools: “Schools I.T. 2000: A Policy
Framework for the New Millennium” (“Schools I.T.”).<label

</span> The policy construes educational technology as a catalyst in Ireland’s
goal to remain economically competitive in the then-revolutionary <a href="./20230729175655.html">information
society</a>. The DES claims, “The need to integrate
technology into teaching and learning right across the curriculum is a major
national challenge that must be met <em>in the interests of Ireland’s future
economic well being</em>”.<label for="fn-DES1998WellBeing" class="margin-toggle
sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-DES1998WellBeing"
class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"> Ibid., § 1.1 (emphasis
mine).</span> The integration of educational technology is explicitly situated
in terms of Ireland’s economy—the demands of its industries and workforce.
Though the purpose of schooling is implied to be the production of a
competitive workforce, it is also implied to be the production of a
fully-realized citizen. Ireland’s economic well-being is threatened not merely
by global, capitalist competition but by the coming information society. The
DES motivates their response to the information society in two ways: first by
positioning Ireland as “catching-up” in an international ranking of
preparedness for the information society;<label for="fn-DES1998Preparedness"
class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox"
id="fn-DES1998Preparedness" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Ibid. §2.1. </span> second, by pointing to the dangers of the information
society. In 1994, the European Council, an executive body of the European
Union, published what is colloquially known as the “Bangemann Report”.<label
for="fn-1994EUCouncil" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input
type="checkbox" id="fn-1994EUCouncil" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote"> The Bangemann Group. “Europe and the Global Information
Society: Recommendations of the High-Level Group on the Information Society to
the Corfu European Council.” Luxembourg: Office for Official Publications of
the European Communities, 1994. <a href="http://aei.pitt.edu/1199/">http://aei.pitt.edu/1199/</a>. </span> The report
outlined the benefits of the coming information age and, immediately important,
its danger:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main risk [of the information society] lies in the creation of a
two-tier society of have and have-nots, in which only a part of the
population has access to the new technology, is comfortable using it and can
fully enjoy its benefits.<label for="fn-1994EUCouncilRisk"

</blockquote>
<p><input type="checkbox" id="fn-1994EUCouncilRisk" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote"> Ibid. pg. 11.</span></p>
<p>The influence of the Bangemann Report in “Schools I.T.” is clear: the DES
explicitly refers to the report and comments on the danger posed by the
“<a href="./20230729175812.html">digital divide</a>” of a two-tiered society.<label
for="fn-des1998social" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input

class="sidenote"> Ireland Department of Education and Science. “Schools I.T.
2000: A Policy Framework for the New Millennium.”, § 2.4</span>
The DES’ integration of educational technology, then, is constructed as an issue
of self-actualization, equality, and equity. It is then appropriate the DES
names such integration and the prevention of a digitally divided society as a
“social” benefit and perhaps the impetus for claiming such technologies’ main
benefit to be computer literacy and motivation.<label
for="fn-des1998computer" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input
type="checkbox" id="fn-des1998computer" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote"> Ibid., § 2.4, 3.1.</span> However, these considerations
are not substitutes for that of educational technology’s role in educational
practice.</p>
<p>At the policy level, Ireland’s economic rationale for educational technology
clouds its considerations for educational practice. “Schools I.T.” considers
the benefits classroom technology may have on students’ computer literacy and
motivation,<label for="fn-des1998motivation" class="margin-toggle
sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-des1998motivation"
class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"> Ibid., § 2.4,
§3.1.</span> but these considerations are made from the perspective of
educational technology as catalyst. Rather, the policy implies the mere
provision of technology and its structure results in its purported benefits in
spite of the initial goal to “integrate technology into teaching and learning
right across the curriculum”.<label for="fn-DES1998Integration"
class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox"
id="fn-DES1998Integration" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Ibid., §1.1.</span> This lack of pedagogical clarity is evident in the
policy’s emphasis on the mere provision of technological infrastructure and the
absence of any emphasis on technologies’ integration in curricula and practice.
It is therefore concluded that, in “Schools I.T. 2000”, the normative
character of the DES’ conception of educational technology consisted in
economics, neglecting the role practice has in its integration. Educational
technology is “good” not for its pedagogic value but its alignment with Irish
economic policy.</p>
<p>It must be noted the act of constructing educational technology as an economic
or social tool does not preclude considerations of its effect on practice. In
1996, two years before “Schools I.T. 2000”, the United States Department of
Education (USDES) began the “Technological Literacy Challenge”: a $2 billion
commitment to ensuring technological literacy among American children.<label
for="fn-1996USDES" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input
type="checkbox" id="fn-1996USDES" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote"> “Getting America’s Students Ready for the 21st Century:
Meeting the Technology Literacy Challenge. A Report to the Nation on Technology
and Education,” June 1996. <a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED398899">https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED398899</a>. </span> As in
Ireland’s policy, there exists an economic character spurred by the coming
information society’s new demands on countries’ workforces. The policy
document opens, “Our children’s future, the future economic health of the
nation, and the competence of America’s future workforce depend on our meeting
this challenge”.<label for="fn-1996USDESWorkforce" class="margin-toggle
sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-1996USDESWorkforce"
class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"> Ibid., pg. 9.</span> The normative
claim between Ireland and the United States is clear: educational technology is
good insofar as it produces a competent workforce. Yet, the latter is far more
articulate in the substantive impacts of educational technology on learning,
instruction, and assessment. The USDES exemplifies simulation programs and, in
different terms, the impact of <a href="./20230729175930.html">procedural rhetoric</a>, the deploying of
<a href="./20230729175441.html">formative assessments</a> as computer-adaptive testing, and new, digital
representations of information facilitating <a href="./20230729175854.html">learner-centered
environments</a>.<label for="fn-1996USDESArticulate" class="margin-toggle
sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-1996USDESArticulate"
class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"> Ibid., pgs. 18–23.</span> Thus,
a second clause may be appended to the USDES’ evaluation of educational
technology: it is good insofar as it produces a competent workforce and,
necessarily, <em>is aligned with practice</em>. As of 1998, then, the U.S.’ direction
of future research and innovation points towards an alignment of technology
with practice; in Ireland, it only points to provision in infrastructure.</p>
<p>Ten years after publishing “Schools I.T. 2000”, the DES published “Investing
Effectively in Information and Communications Technology in Schools,
2008–2013” (“Investing Effectively”).<label for="fn-2008DESInvesting" class="margin-toggle

</span> Contrasted with its predecessor, “Investing Effectively” demonstrates
the start of Ireland’s pedagogical maturation with regards to educational
technology. The DES observes children, “engage in informal learning across a
continuum of digital activity in ingenious and impressive ways” and construct
“ICT-enabled styles” of learning such that the, “very nature of learning is
changing”.<label for="fn-2008DESNature" class="margin-toggle

class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Ibid., pg. 2.</span>
Here, the virtues of educational technology are derived from its alignment
with the learners’ way of reading, thinking, and knowing. The primary impetus
for educational technology is not its purported economic benefits but instead
its benefits to the learner and, incidentally, practice. The implied value
identified in this new evaluation of educational technology is its affording of
new ways to align educational practice with learners’ minds. Further, the DES
takes pains to distinguish itself from “Schools I.T. 2000”, observing
“Investing Effectively” represents a shift away from the mere provision of
technological infrastructure and towards the ways in which learners may use
technology and prepare for <a href="./20230729175511.html">life-long learning</a>.<label for="fn-2008DESShift"
class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox"
id="fn-2008DESShift" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Ibid., pgs.
1–13.</span></p>
<p>Ireland’s shifting construction of educational technology reflects a similar
shift occurring the United States. In 2001, American education consultant
Marc Prensky coined, a then-innovative though now controversial, construct:
the distinction between digital natives and immigrants.</p>
<p>While “Investing Effectively” represents the introduction of pedagogic norms
in Ireland’s conception of educational technology, economic supremacy continues
to be a strong rationale for it. Plainly, the DES states Ireland’s
“enviable economic growth” can only continue by preparing its students for
the “evolving knowledge society” or, with greater transparency, “to contribute
to [Ireland’s] continued economic success”.<label for="fn-2008DESEconomics"
class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox"
id="fn-2008DESEconomics" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Ibid.,
pgs. 2, 12.</span> This iteration of Ireland’s economic rationale departs from
the rhetoric of an international race to prepare for the information society,
but it remains situated in the ever-evolving demands the global information
economy imposes on the workforce. However, the DES’ continued linking of
educational technologies with economic development does not detract from the
significant progression “Investing Effectively” represents. Irish educational
technology, at this stage, has a sophisticated, dual-normative character whose
implied direction of research and innovation points towards the alignment of
practice and in-industry demands.</p>
<p>“Investing Effectively”‘s trend of pedagogical maturation is continued in
the DES’ latest iteration of educational technology policy: “Digital Strategy
for Schools to 2027” (“Digital Strategy”).<label for="fn-2008DESEconomics" class="margin-toggle
sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-2008DESEconomics"
class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"> Ireland Department of Education.

</span> The DES makes clear their commitment to aligning educational
technologies with practice rather than economic imperatives by stating, “At the
core of the strategy is the continued approach of <em>pedagogy first technology
second</em>, where the use of technology… does more than merely replicate
traditional practices.”<label for="fn-2022DESCore" class="margin-toggle
sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-2022DESCore"
class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"> Ibid., pg. 22. </span>
When contrasted with initial policy, it becomes clear the central standard by
which the DES evaluates educational technology, the central norm, is its
effect on practice. The economic benefits of such technologies are relegated to
afterthoughts—happenstances of innovative practice. This new normative
character is further implied in the degree with which the DES articulates the
benefits of educational technology: they construct it as a tool offering
students multiple means of engagement, representation, and expression, potent
opportunities for active, self-directed learning, and platforms for new,
formative assessments.<label for="fn-2022DESObjectives" class="margin-toggle
sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-2022DESObjectives"
class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"> Ibid., pgs. 28, 23, 40. </span>
Furthermore, the contrast between the current and previous policies is further
evidenced in “Baseline Report: Towards a Successor Digital Strategy for
Schools to 2027”, a report related to “Digital Strategy”. Within it, the DES explicitly
rejects the catalytic characterization of educational technology constructed in
“Schools I.T. 2000”: educational technology, they state, is not “necessarily a
driver or catalyst for change” nor does it imply the “development of innovative
teaching practices”.<label for="fn-2008DESEconomics" class="margin-toggle

pg. 38. </span> The DES’ conception of educational technology is wholly
situated in the educational sciences rather than economic imperatives.</p>
<p>At this stage, the DES’ conception and evaluation of educational technology
is not only well-aligned with the values of educational science but also with
those of the USDES. The USDES’ latest iteration of educational technology
policy is found in “Reimagining the Role of Technology in Education”, and it
bears many parallels to the DES’.<label for="fn-USDES2017" class="margin-toggle
sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-USDES2017"
class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">United States Office of

Education, January 2017. <a href="https://tech.ed.gov/files/2017/01/NETP17.pdf">https://tech.ed.gov/files/2017/01/NETP17.pdf</a>.
</span> Like the DES, the USDES continues to motivate educational technology
from an economic rationale, conceiving of it as a necessity if U.S. learners
are to “remain competitive in the global economy”,<label for="fn-USDES20171"
class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox"
id="fn-USDES20171" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Ibid., pg. 8.
</span> but the motivation is ultimately secondary to the pedagogical affordances
of such technologies. For example, the USDES rejects the catalytic perspective 
of educational technology in declaring “Technology alone does not transform
learning; rather, technology helps enable transformative learning.”<label
for="fn-USDES20172" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input
type="checkbox" id="fn-USDES20172" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">Ibid., pg. 42. </span> Critically, the USDES does not state
technology alone enables transformative learning, instead implying technology
aligned with practice does so. Further, the USDES builds upon the digital
divide observed in the Bangemann Report and Ireland’s initial policies by
constructing a “digital-use divide”: a division between students who “use
technology in ways that transform their learning” and those who merely use it
to “complete the same activates but with an electronic device”.<label
for="fn-USDES20172" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input
type="checkbox" id="fn-USDES20172" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">Ibid., pg. 7. </span> By some measure, it appears EU rhetoric
regarding technology and its social implications has reverberated to the U.S.
and, implicitly, situates Ireland ahead of the U.S. in those terms. These
parallels between the U.S. and DES not only evidence the common, economic
motivation between the two countries but demonstrate such motivations do
not preclude an educational or learner-centered evaluation of educational
technologies.</p>
<p>Throughout its brief history, educational technology policy in Ireland
demonstrates a gradual maturation in terms of the norms deployed to evaluate
such technologies. As evidenced in the text of “Schools I.T.”, the DES first
evaluated educational technology primarily by its economic affordances and
largely neglected its relationship with educational practice. Contrasts with
the USDES’ policy implies the economic rationale was a product of the
countries’ economic response to the information society but does not itself
preclude considerations of pedagogy. However, subsequent and recent policies,
such as “Investing Effectively” and “Digital Strategy”, demonstrate the DES now
evaluates educational technologies primarily by their relationship with sound
practice and rejects the catalytic construction of educational technology they
initially held. In short, Ireland, as represented by the DES, regards
educational technology as a tool whose effective use implies alignment with
practice and the demands of the global knowledge economy.</p>
