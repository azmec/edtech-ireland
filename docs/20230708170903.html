<p>Scientific research is subject to normativity: its structure and direction is
determined by the standards used to evaluate it. In Ireland, in-industry
research regarding educational technology is subject to two standards: those
set by the Department of Education (DES), and those set by the Department of
Enterprise, Trade and Employment (DETE). The DES’ ontology and evaluation of
educational technology remains as it was observed to be in its <a href="20230708170134.html">educational
technology policy</a>. However, the DETE is a distinct entity
designed to better Ireland’s economy and seeks to couple academic and industry
research; intuitively, its ontology and evaluation of educational technology
must differ. These distinctions are evident in the center of Irish educational
technology research, the Learnovate Technology Centre, and peripheral research
entities such as the Irish Learning Technology Association and EdTech Ireland.</p>
<p>The DETE first explicitly coupled general scientific research with industry
demands under their 2007 Competence Centre Programme, as described in their
“Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation 2006~2013” (“Strategy for
Science”).<label

</span> Generally, competence centers are institutions
working in close collaboration with higher education institutes and relevant
industry members. However, like its educational policy, Ireland’s enterprise
policy is situated in the rapidly evolving demands of the information or
knowledge economy. For example, in a related press report, Marcy Cryan, Chair of the DETE’s
Advisory Science Council, regards the strategy as a demonstration of Ireland’s
intent to “stay with the leading pack of countries in this transition [into a
knowledge economy] and to develop as one of the most attractive locations for
world-class researchers and knowledge intensive enterprises.”<label

</span> Thus, the competence centers introduced in the
strategy are situated in a broad effort to ensure Ireland keeps
pace with its international peers in research, development, and the general
production and use of human capital. 
At the normative level, the motivations for competence centres appear no
different than those for educational technology in the DES’ initial policies.
Further, the economic character of these
institutions is made clear in “Strategy for Science” itself. The DETE regards competence
centers as tools to “differentiate Ireland as a highly attractive environment”
for “advanced industrial research” and limit their scope to industries of
“strategically important technologies where a clear industry need is
established”.<label for="fn-2006DETECompetence" class="margin-toggle

class="margin-toggle"/> <span class="sidenote"> Department of Enterprise, Trade
and Employment. “Strategy for Science, Technology, and Innovation 2006~2013.”,
pg. 47. </span> Therefore, the research conducted in competence centres is
performed with the explicit intent for application in the relevant industry so as
to produce an attractive environment for research and investment. It is
appropriate, then, the DETE delegated the responsibility of these centres to
Ireland’s indigenous and foreign investment agencies: Enterprise Ireland and
IDA Ireland.<label for="fn-2006DETEEI" class="margin-toggle

operate today as a joint initiative between Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland
but under a new name: Technology Centres. Further, in 2012, the
technology-enhanced learning research institute Learnovate Technology Centre
launched in Trinity College  Dublin. The centre provides bespoke educational
technology research and innovation to the private enterprises or institutions

</span> As a normative object, what Learnovate presents is an instance of
educational technology being driven simultaneously by educational practice, as
a consequence of what has been established to work in research, and industry
demand. This union is further evidenced in the nature of its projects. For
example, in 2022, the Learnovate Centre received €300,000 through Enterprise
Ireland’s commercialisation fund to realize project ALPACA: an application to
assess children’s phonemic skills through a gamified experience.<label

<p>Today, Learnovate has broadened its scope to include the research, development,
and commercialization of workplace learning technology, aligning itself with
Ireland and the EU’s <a href="./20230729175511.html">life-long learning framework</a>. In 2023, Learnovate
secured €3,000,000 to initiate a phase of transition away from innovation in
educational technology and towards research in facilitating “ongoing
learning” through online, adaptive, and soft-skills learning.<label

This pivot from innovative educational technologies in schools most reveals
Learnovate’s origins as an initiative from the DETE and, pointedly, the
collaboration evident in Ireland’s educational and economic policy. The impetus
for this pivot, a rapidly changing knowledge economy, is well-aligned with
the norms observed in Ireland’s educational policy. Education, or more broadly
learning, is a point-of-interest not merely for the pursuit of knowledge
or actualization of the student but for the opportunities it provides the
student to become and remain economically competitive. This new direction in
research has since manifested in a €4,000 project between Learnovate
and its patron members Cisco and Skillnet Ireland designed to close digital
skill-gaps through an online self-assessment and development platform. The
close collaboration between Ireland’s education and economic policy is further
evidenced by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research,
Innovation, and Science Simon Harris’ construing of the project as assisting
“Ireland to continue in its aim to develop a workforce that is technologically
advanced, highly-skilled, and ready for the future of work.”<label for="fn-LearnovateCisco" class="margin-toggle

</span> Learnovate’s pivot demonstrates educational technological encompasses a
far larger domain than classroom technology and software: to Ireland, and
international companies insofar as Ireland exports its achievements to them, it
represents an opportunity to remain economically competitive in a changing
economic landscape.</p>
<p>Learnovate is far from the only Irish educational technology research institute
intersecting with the industry. The Irish Learning Technology Association
(ITLA), for example, is an independent community of industry professionals and
academic researchers specializing in the study of technology-enhanced learning
or, plainly, educational technology.<label for="fn-ITLA" class="margin-toggle

Association. “The Irish Learning Technology Association.” Accessed July 9, 2023.
<a href="https://ilta.ie/">https://ilta.ie/</a>. </span> The ITLA contributes to the industry’s knowledge in
two ways: first, by publishing the Irish Journal of Technology Enhanced
Learning, a peer-reviewed academic journal;<label for="fn-ITLA-Journal"

<a href="https://journal.ilta.ie/index.php/telji/about">https://journal.ilta.ie/index.php/telji/about</a>. </span> second, by supporting
a network of Irish educational technology industry leaders through two annual
conferences. For example, the ITLA’s 2018 EdTech Conference saw presentations
from enterprise leaders such as TurnItIn, Panopto, IT Tralee, Cleverbooks, and
PebblePad in addition to the expected universities such as Maynooth University,
National University of Ireland Galway, and Trinity College Dublin.<label

Accessed July 30, 2023. <a href="http://programme.exordo.com/edtech2018/">http://programme.exordo.com/edtech2018/</a>. </span>
There exists a clear coupling between academic and in-industry research beyond
the technology centres of the DETE. Further, many of the attending enterprises
are multinational, such as TurnItIn and Panopto. This diversity shows that
ITLA’s EdTech Conference and similar conferences represent entry-points into
the educational technology sector and its research at the international level.</p>
<p>The scope of educational technology research widens further when one considers
organizations such as EdTech Ireland. An innovation network founded in 2022,
EdTech Ireland boasts 41 industry members within its network, containing
multinationals such as Learnosity, ESI, and Akari Software.<label

EdTech Ireland represents a funnel outwards into the European Union (EU) insofar as it is a
member of the European EdTech Alliance, a network of educational technology
enterprises and trade associations set upon growing the industry across Europe.<label

<p>In summary, the research component of Ireland’s educational technology sector
demonstrates an intertwining of the normativity of educational and economic
imperatives. At first glance, the DETE appears to contrast the DES’ established
fusing of educational and economic imperatives by investing in educational
technology research as a means to differentiate Ireland from its global
competitors. However, the role such research plays in the sector, as
represented through the Learnovate Technology Centre, demonstrates an
alignment of the two imperatives. Further, organizations like ILTA and
EdTech Ireland not only further the purely educational imperative of
educational technology but also link the country’s enterprises to academic
research and international networks spanning the EU. This broad confluence
of educational and economic norms and rhetorics underscores the partnership
between the DES, DETE, and enterprise in Ireland and shows that such unions
are feasible.</p>
