<p>As established in surveys of Ireland’s <a href="./20230708170134.html">educational technology policy</a>
and <a href="./20230708170903.html">research institutions</a>, there exists of diversity of
interests among the sector’s stakeholders. Historically, the industry appealed
economically to policymakers, enticing them with promises of an globally
competitive workforce. This initial, economic rationale arose in anticipation
of the <a href="./20230729175655.html">information society</a>, which has since been
realized in our global economy. Presently, the sector appeals to policymakers,
academics, instructors, students, and businesses for the myriad pedagogic or
practical affordances its technologies imply. In short, the diversity of the
interests held by educational technology’s stakeholders is reflected in the
composition of its enterprises, as exemplified by assessment, courseware,
virtual reality, and game-based learning enterprises.</p>
<p>Assessment software is perhaps the most general mode of educational technology.
<a href="./20230729175441.html">Assessment</a> is, in brief, the task of qualifying or
quantifying what a learner knows. It is natural, then, the process is among the
most important in education as it validates the instruction process. Though
educational technologies propose many transformations for the assessment
process, the simplest is the enhancement of a mode of assessment typically
infeasible: <a href="./20230729175441.html">formative assessments</a>. Briefly, a formative
assessment is an assessment designed to document learner knowledge and
course-correct their understanding if necessary. The “formative” component of
this assessment is delivered through comprehensive feedback on the part of the
instructor. Though difficult in practice, Irish enterprises JumpAGrade and
Nurture attempt to ease and innovate on the process.</p>
<p>The two assessment software enterprises JumpAGrade and Nurture were founded by
David Neville and Pádraic Hogan, and the character of their enterprises reflect
the values set out in the Department of Education’s (DES) policies and the role
of research within the sector. JumpAGrade, for example, is an online tutoring
service affording students one-on-one feedback from purportedly expert-level
tutors assisted with machine-learning algorithms. Co-founder Ethan O’Brien
situates the service well-within the concept of educational technology built by
the DES, claiming it, “pair[s] humans’ ability to make judgements based on
expertise and experience with computers’ powerful pattern recognition
capabilities” and, alongside Neville and Hogan, “share[s] a vision to assist
people to be lifelong learners”<label for="fn-JumpAGrade2" class="margin-toggle

<a href="https://www.siliconrepublic.com/start-ups/jumpagrade-grinds-education">https://www.siliconrepublic.com/start-ups/jumpagrade-grinds-education</a>.</span>.
The co-founders imply it is not merely the addition of technology transforming
the assessment process but instead the combination of technology and sound
practice, “humans’ ability to make judgements based on expertise”, raising the
bar in educational assessment. Further, the product is clearly situated in the
context of the European Union (EU) and Ireland’s <a href="./20230729175511.html">lifelong learning
framework</a>, demonstrating not only how entrenched the idea
is in Irish education but also how aligned the product is with it.</p>
<p>Neville and Hogan continue to innovate assessment, without O’Brein, at Nurture.
Unlike JumpAGrade, Nurture is an online assessment platform integrated into
Microsoft Teams designed for one-to-many relationships—one teacher to many
students. It is analogous to a learning management system: teachers may create
assignments, receive student work, and grade and give feedback on the work.
However, Neville and Hogan deliver a user-interface and functionalities that,
bluntly, guide the instructor towards best formative assessment practices.
Within the platform, the duo realize a “feedback loop” consisting of assignment
creation, assignment submission, instructor feedback, student reflection, and
the summarization of student data for instructor insights.<label

</figure>
<p>At no point throughout this process is technology the definitive transformer.
Instead, it is, at all points, an enabler of sound practice. Neville and Hogan
go to great pains to emphasize this, constantly situating their product in
education and cognitive science research and, important to present analysis,
their collaboration with the Learnovate Centre.<label

<p>The general broadening of educational technology to include instruction on
workplace competencies or implementations of the lifelong learning framework
is additionally observed in the “courseware” space of the sector. Courseware
enterprise Spotlight Skills, for instance, provides course content for
high-school-equivalent students on workplace competencies like interpersonal
communication, relationship-building, and decision-making.<label
for="fn-SpotlightSkills" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label> <input

id="fn-SpotlightLearnovate" class="margin-toggle"/> <span class="sidenote">
Ibid.</span> the course modules are indicative of the entrenchment of lifelong
learning within Ireland’s educational institutions, research, and enterprises.
In other words, one may interpret the project as a representative of the
normative claim that the purpose of schooling amounts to economic preparation,
wherein educational technology is a means to economic competitiveness. Yet,
the presence of Learnovate implies a degree of pedagogic alignment insofar as
Spotlight Skills is as backed by research as it claims.</p>
<p>Regardless of subject-matter or instructional content, however, it must be
recognized educational technology enterprises rely on a diversity of skill-sets
and industries to compose their products. The nascent mobile application
enterprise Little Red Edu is most exemplary of this. Little Red Edu, founded by
Anna Carmody, is a mobile application delivering
<a href="./20230719175255.html">gamified</a> English-language learning lessons through a
subscription-based service. Children repeat or read-aloud English words or
phrases, and the application assesses their pronunciation through voice
recognition technology.<label for="fn-LittleRedEdu" class="margin-toggle

The product is ostensibly a confluence of game, instruction, and assessment
design—each of which working in tandem to create an effecting learning
experience. Of note, however, is the reliance the application has on Soapbox
Labs, a Learnovate spin-in, and subsequent spin-out, providing a low-code
interface to voice recognition technology trained on child voice data.<label

<p>Educational reformer John Dewey forever criticized the “traditional scheme” of
education, wherein the information and skills of the past generation are
imposed onto the nascent minds of the current generations’ students without
regard for their experiences. The gap in the experience required to digest the
subject-matter and the experience held by the students is so great that the
material is foreign.<label for="fn-Dewey1986" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label> <input

Irish educational technology enterprise SchooVR is shifting this matter.</p>
<p>Founded by Mark Baldwin, SchooVR provides to teachers and students a library of
VR course-content and a platform to build educational VR experiences. At the
individual level, Baldwin’s conception of the role VR technology has to play in
education is well-aligned with that of the DES. When interviewed by the Irish
Times, Baldwin claimed, “Today’s ‘digital natives’ need more than words on a
page”,<label for="fn-DublinSchooVR" class="margin-toggle

class="margin-toggle"/> <span class="sidenote"> Keogh, Olive. “Teacher’s

echoing the DES’ claim in <em>Investing Effectively</em> that students’ technological
ecosystem has fundamentally changed learning and directly lifting Mark
Prensky’s <a href="./20230729180023.html">digital native</a> concept. This demonstrates the
perspective of educational technology wherein it must be aligned with learner’s
experiences (i.e., learner-centered). Further, in alignment with the DES’
policy for instructors to be competent in the tools necessary to enact policy,
educational institutions are using SchooVR tools and content to train
student-teachers. In 2021, the Trinity College of Dublin invited
student-teachers to participate in a course teaching the use of immersive
technologies in the classroom.<label for="fn-DublinSchooVR2"

Not only was this project an attempt to explore the ramifications of
immersive technologies in the classroom, it represented a fulfilment of the
need for instructors to be trained in the new media technology affords.
Baldwin’s SchooVR presents is a concise demonstration of the not only the
presence of VR in Ireland’s educational technology industry but also its
intersecting with educational institutions and the DES’ policy.</p>
<p>What SchooVR’s integration in classrooms and student-teacher training points
to is a need for the educational technology sector to recognize VR and
game-based learning as new forms of media requiring new forms appreciation and
design. Michele Dickey argued aesthetics, or experiences, significantly
contribute to learning experiences such that instructors are largely already
in the business of crafting aesthetic experiences, similar to game-designers.
Thus, she argues instructors wishing to adopt games or immersive technologies
in the classroom must understand how aesthetics, or game-design principles,
function in virtual experiences.<label for="fn-Dickey2019" class="margin-toggle

Routledge, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, 2015.</span> Situated in the Irish context,
Dickey’s argument becomes an extension of the DES’ conception of educational
technology: game-based or immersive learning, as technologies, cannot be
regarded as the singular catalysts for transformative learning but instead
enablers thereof when aligned with practice. What game-based or immersive
learning supply are experiences. It is with view, that the aesthetics of
game-based and immersive learning must be aligned with practice, Irish
enterprises Mersus Technologies is examined.</p>

<p>Evidently, Ireland’s educational technology enterprises are incredibly diverse
in the interests they meet and their evaluative approach to the merits of
educational technologies. Assessment enterprises like JumpAGrade and Nurture
demonstrate a strongly learning-theory aligned approach to educational
technologies, continually situating the medium in relation to good educational
practice. Courseware enterprises like Spotlight Skills exemplify the economic
motive that continues to exist in the DES’ construction of educational
technologies under the learning for life framework, and Little Red Edu
demonstrates the confluence of disciplines within the industry. However,
immersive enterprises like SchooVR and Mersus Technologies point towards the
future of industry, wherein the aesthetics of interactive experiences are
either deeply integrated into course-content or, as it is now, merely borrowed
and “tacked on” to existing practices.</p>
