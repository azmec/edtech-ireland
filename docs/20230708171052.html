			<h1>Irish Educational Technology</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Enterprise</p>
<section>
<p>As established in surveys of Ireland’s <a href="./20230708170134.html">educational technology
policy</a> and <a href="./20230708170903.html">research institutions</a>,
the industry’s stakeholders and their interests are diverse. Educational
technology has been shown to, historically, been viewed as a catalyst for
modernisation, a necessity for the global knowledge
economy, and an enabler for transformative learning when aligned with practice.
Appropriately, this diversity is seen in Ireland’s educational technology
enterprises.</p>
<p>It was previously discussed the DES values educational technology for the ways
it may transform and personalize <a href="./20230729175441.html">assessment</a>. Among these transformative
modes of assessments are <a href="./20230729175441.html">formative assessments</a>, with which Irish enterprise
JumpAGrade and Nurture are transforming the educational technology sector. Both
enterprises were established by David Neville and Pádraic Hogan and
well-situated within Ireland’s plain-education market. JumpAGrade, for
instance, competes with Irish cram schools, called “grinds”, by offering an
online tutoring service providing personalized assessment feedback.

In this way, JumpAGrade reflects the DES’ valuation of educational technology
by directly integrating technology into existing, sound pedagogy: consistent,
personalized feedback is good whether it is offline or digital. Neville and
Hogan’s latest venture, Nurture, continues this trend of closing the feedback
loop. Nurture offers an assessment platform facilitating instructors’ feedback
at the task, process, and holistic level, facilitating the formative assessment
pattern. In addition, students may report their confidence levels in tasks and
fulfilling reflection forms with every task submission.<label for="fn-Nurture"

</span> Further, Nurture is research-backed by Learnovate, again demonstrating
the research institutes influence on the educational technology sector.<label

</span> This is, once again, a digitization of already sound educational
practice—a leveraging of technology to make once infeasible teaching
strategies, offering personalized, self-regulated feedback to all students,
feasible. Furthermore, Neville and Hogan continue to push the envelope by
integrating this assessment platform with artificial intelligence by Open AI
and Microsoft’s Teams platform. The Irish educational technology platform spans
far and wide.</p>
<p>As the presence of the <a href="./20230729175655.html">knowledge or information society</a> was felt in the
DES’ educational policy, it continues to ring in Ireland’s educational
technology sector. Well before Learnovate re-aligned itself with Ireland’s
<a href="./20230729175511.html">learning-for-life framework</a>, courseware enterprise Spotlight Skills was
targeting this market. Spotlight Skills provides courseware instructing
high-school students in workplace competencies such as interpersonal
communication, relationship-building, and decision-making.<label

class="sidenote"> Spotlight Skills. “Spotlight Skills | Schools.” Accessed June
25, 2023. <a href="https://www.spotlightskills.com/schools">https://www.spotlightskills.com/schools</a>.</span> Not only does the
enterprise represent the economic interest of educational technology, it
further demonstrates the influence the Irish government has on the sector.
Spotlight Skills collaborated with Learnovate to develop the instruction and
assessment tools composing its courseware, and the enterprise was supported by
Enterprise Ireland.<label for="fn-SpotlightLearnovate" class="margin-toggle
sidenote-number"></label> <input type="checkbox" id="fn-SpotlightLearnovate"
class="margin-toggle"/> <span class="sidenote"> Ibid.</span> Though educational
technology is typically regarded as the application of virtual realities or
games, it is clearly additionally seen as an opportunity to ensure students are
competent in the workplace.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="">Game-based or interactive learning software</a> exemplifies many of the
principles of educational technology espoused by the DES in their policy. In
addition, it is perhaps the broadest domain of educational technology.</li>
</ul>
<p>It must be recognized educational technology enterprises rely on a diversity of
skill-sets and industries to compose their products. The nascent mobile
application enterprise Little Red Edu is most exemplary of this. Little Red
Edu, founded by Anna Carmody, is a mobile application delivering
<a href="./20230719175255.html">gamified</a> English-language learning lessons through a
subscription-based service. Children repeat or read-aloud English words or
phrases, and the application assesses their pronunciation.<label

2023.<a href="https://littlerededu.com/about-our-story/">https://littlerededu.com/about-our-story/</a>.</span> Here, the “technology”
of the educational technology product amounts to an automated assessment system
and game-elements, reflecting a facet of the DES’ policy. Of note, however, is
the reliance the application has on Soapbox Labs, a Learnovate spin-in, and
subsequent spin-out, providing a low-code interface to voice recognition
technology trained on child voice data.<label for="fn-O'Connor2019"

</span> Little Red Edu, then, straddles the domains of pedagogy, visual design,
game design, and, as a dependency, machine learning. Further, it is reliant on
the research performed by the Learnovate Centre insofar as Soapbox Labs remains
under the research institute, demonstrating the role the institute plays in the
educational technology sector.</p>
<p>Father of education John Dewey forever criticized the “traditional scheme” of
education, wherein the information and skills of the past generation are
imposed onto the nascent minds of the current generations’ students without
regard for their experiences. The gap in the experience required to digest the
subject-matter and the experience held by the students is so great that the
material is foreign.<label for="fn-Dewey1986" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label> <input

Virtual reality (VR) proposes to
facilitate students’ acquiring of the experiences necessary to close the gap.
Virtual reality implies a movement from text-based instruction to symbol-based
instruction, giving students the experiences necessary to make sense of foreign
subject-matters.<label for="fn-Helsel1992" class="margin-toggle

Irish educational technology enterprise SchooVR is shifting this matter.</p>
<p>Founded by Mark Baldwin, SchooVR provides teachers and students a platform to
build educational VR experiences and a library of VR course-content. At the
individual level, Baldwin’s conception of the role VR technology has to play in
education is well-aligned with that of the DES. When interviewed by the Irish
Times, Baldwin claimed, “Today’s ‘digital natives’ need more than words on a
page”,<label for="fn-DublinSchooVR" class="margin-toggle

class="margin-toggle"/> <span class="sidenote"> Keogh, Olive. “Teacher’s

echoing the DES’ <em>Investing Effectively</em> claim students’
technological ecosystem has fundamentally changed learning and directly lifting
Mark Prensky’s <a href="./20230729180023.html">digital native</a> concept. This demonstrates the perspective of
educational technology wherein it must be aligned with learner’s experiences
(i.e., learner-centered). Further, in alignment with the DES’ policy for
instructors to be competent in the tools necessary to enact policy, educational
institutions are using SchooVR tools and content to train student-teachers. In
2021, the Trinity College of Dublin invited student-teachers to participate in
a course teaching the use of immersive technologies in the classroom.

Baldwin’s SchooVR presents is a concise demonstration of the not only the
presence of VR in Ireland’s educational technology industry but also its
intersecting with educational institutions and the DES’ policy.</p>
<p>Yet, there continues to be a need to progress the conception of game-based
learning, particularly in the mode of integrating game-design principles and
ensuring instructors possess the competencies necessary to develop and use
games. Irish enterprise Jetpack Learning fulfills the latter half of the
bargain, providing a platform to build HTML-5-based games.<label

Though Learnovate’s influence is once-more witnessed in Jetpack Learning’s
collaboration with the research-institute,<label for="fn-JetpackLearnovate" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label> <input

a survey of the enterprise’s showcased games demonstrates an unfortunate
integration of game design principles and aesthetics. Dickey (2019) argued
for the necessity of instructors to become familiar with game-design principles
on the ground that instructors are already in the business of designing
aesthetic experiences and, most important, the benefit of game-based learning
emerges from a systemic application of such principles.<label

</span> If game-based learning is to progress seriously within educational 
technologies, instructors must not only possess the tools to develop
content-relevant games but also be competent with games as a medium of
expression.</p>
