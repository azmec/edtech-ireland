			<h1><em>Schools I.T. 2000</em></h1>
<p><em><strong>Schools I.T. 2000</strong></em> is a public policy framework regarding the integration of
technologies in schools published by the Irish Department of Education in 1998.

supposed economic and catalytic potentials and, inadvertently, neglect the
pedagogical potential of it.</p>
