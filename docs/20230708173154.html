			<h1>Digital Strategy for Schools to 2027</h1>
<p><em>Digital Strategy for Schools to 2027</em> is a 2022 policy publication produced by the
Irish Department of Education and, when compared to its predecessors, represents
a radical repositioning of educational technology as a tool to be integrated with and
valued for sound pedagogic practice rather economic motivations.</p>
