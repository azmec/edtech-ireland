			<h1>Irish Assessment Software Enterprises</h1>
<p>The act of integrating technology into assessment processes, within the DES’ value
system, represents both a streamlining of the education process and an enhancement of
sound practice. Ireland’s edtech industry is home to many enterprises providing
assessment software frameworks through learning management systems or attempting
to revolutionize the process through unique technologies, but each remain in the business
of aiding educators in their documenting of student knowledge. Though vast, such
enterprises will be sampled by two: JumpAGrade and TestReach.</p>
<p>JumpAGrade enhances assessment by using machine learning to construct formative
assessments of students in grind schools. It is funded by Enterprise Ireland and
research-backed by Learnovate. JumpAGrade exemplifies not only the government’s
interest in edtech but also edtech’s placement within the Irish education system.</p>
<ul>
<li>Evolved into Nurture</li>
</ul>
<p>TestReach is another one.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Not as firmly entrenched in Ireland’s education system, but it remains representative of the opportunities technology can provide to assessment processes.</p>
