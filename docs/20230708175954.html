			<h1>Irish Online Courseware Enterprises</h1>
<p>“Courseware” refers to courses delivered through software. It is a broad mode of
instruction, encompassing everything from digital texts to virtual lessons, online videos,
and online assessments. Further, courseware exists beyond educational institutions: it
describes tutorial and programs designed to train or “upskill” laborers already in the job
market. Within Ireland, therefore, the phenomena can be considered in light of Ireland’s
existing educational technology policy as well as its policy regarding adult education.
This perspective is explored through the lens of three courseware companies, each
representing a unique motivation for courseware and edtech in general: Spotlight Skills, the Institute of Sustainability Studies, and Learning Pool.</p>
