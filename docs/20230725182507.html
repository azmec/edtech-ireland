<p>The Competence Centre Programme continues to operate today under Enterprise and
IDA Ireland but under a new name: Technology Centres. However, no explicit
report of this name-change published by either the Department of Enterprise,
Trade and Employment, Enterprise Ireland, or IDA Ireland has been identified.
At the programme’s genesis, Enterprise Ireland reported expenditures and
expansions to the programme in their “Annual Report” series of publications. In
their 2007 report, for instance, they describe the program as affording Irish
enterprises opportunities to “engage in higher risk, longer-term research that
will give them a competitive edge in international markets”.<label

</span> Enterprise Ireland makes similar references to the program in 2008 and
2009 but not 2010 and onward, instead crediting the then-new Technology Centre
Programme for affording enterprises opportunities to “achieve the kind of
transformational change required to develop new technologies and bring
innovative products and services to market”.<label for="fn-foobar1"

describing the transition.</p>
