<p class="subtitle">From Competence Centres to Technology Centres</p>
<section>
<p>The Competence Centre Programme continues to operate today under Enterprise and
IDA Ireland but under a new name: Technology Centres. However, no explicit
report of this name change published by either the DETE, EI, or IDA Ireland has
been identified. At the programme’s genesis, EI reported expenditures and
expansions to the programme in their <em>Annual Report</em> series of publications. In
their 2007 report, for instance, they describe the program as affording Irish
enterprises opportunities to, “engage in higher risk, longer-term research
that will give them a competitive edge in international markets” (29). EI makes
similar references to the program in 2008 and 2009 but not 2010 and onward,
instead credited to the then-new Technology Centre Programme for affording
enterprises opportunities to, “achieve the kind of transformational change
required to develop new technologies and bring innovative products and services
to market” (12). Further, Enterprise Ireland’s webpage for the program properly
described the program in length in 17 December 2010 (CITE). By 16 April 2013,
the page had been modified <em>only</em> to read “Technology Centres Initiative”
rather than “Competence Centres Initiative” (CITE). This evidence is presented
due to the absence of primary documents describing the transition.</p>
