<p>As observed in Ireland’s <a href="20230708170134.html">educational technology policy</a>,
the initial impetus for the integration of technologies in the classroom was
twofold: first, businesses demanded the Irish workforce be competent in the
application of such technologies in the business context; second, continued
innovation in internet and communications technologies required the workforce
be capable of continuous learning. Ireland’s initial educational technology
policy attempted to address the first demand through the provision and use of
technological infrastructure, affording students the opportunity to develop
computer and digital literacies. However, it may be more accurate to qualify
this attempt as a component of Ireland’s attempt to address the second demand:
the demand for lifelong learning.</p>
<p>In 1999, the Government of Ireland published “Ready to Learn”, a whitepaper on
childhood education.<label for="fn-1999DES" class="margin-toggle

to Learn.” The Stationary Office, 1999.

</span> In brief, the Government outlined a number of strategies to support
children’s development and achievement in early education. In doing so, the
Government lays out a formula for lifelong learning without explicitly naming
the construct. For example, the Government contrasts what it believes education
ought to be against what it believes it once was: the consideration that,
“education began when children went to school and ended when students left the
formal education system at the end of first, second, or third level” (8).<label

type="checkbox" id="fn-1999DES2" class="margin-toggle"/> <span
class="sidenote"> Ibid., pg. 8. </span> Rather, the Government expands the
notion of education beyond the limits of educational institutions and ought to
be concerned with the learner in all stages of their life or, succinctly, their
lifelong learning. With regards to childhood learning, the whitepaper is an
opportunity for the Government to outline strategies to instill a “disposition”
in children inclining them to “adjust well to the transition to the primary
school system” and “have the capacity and motivation to master new skills and
challenges”.<label for="fn-1999DES3" class="margin-toggle

class="margin-toggle"/> <span class="sidenote"> Ibid., pg. 18. </span> “Ready
to Learn” was the Government’s first attempt to lay a foundation for lifelong
learning in its workforce, though the Government never refers to “lifelong
learning” in name.</p>
<p>The Government of Ireland soon formalized their concept of lifelong learning
under the Department of Education’s (DES) 2000 whitepaper “Learning for Life”,
a policy document for adult learning.<label for="fn-2000DES" class="margin-toggle
sidenote-number"></label> <input type="checkbox" id="fn-2000DES"
class="margin-toggle"/> <span class="sidenote"> Ireland Department of Education and Science. “Learning for Life: White Paper on
Adult Education.” The Stationary Office, July 2000.
<a href="https://assets.gov.ie/24723/8eaa8222690f43279dd017f686427e9b.pdf">https://assets.gov.ie/24723/8eaa8222690f43279dd017f686427e9b.pdf</a>. </span> The
DES’ definition is simple, regarding lifelong learning as the, “systematic
learning undertaken by adults who return to learning having concluded initial
education or training”.<label for="fn-2000DES1" class="margin-toggle
sidenote-number"></label> <input type="checkbox" id="fn-2000DES1"
class="margin-toggle"/> <span class="sidenote"> Ibid., § 1.3. </span> The
DES situates lifelong learning in the Irish context by claiming the
implementation of a lifelong learning strategy may elicit personal and cultural
development, higher social awareness and responsibility, increase in social and
intellectual capital for individuals, competitiveness in the knowledge economy,
and engagement in cultural and communal development.<label for="fn-2000DES1"
class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label> <input type="checkbox"
id="fn-2000DES1" class="margin-toggle"/> <span class="sidenote"> Ibid., §
1.4.2–1.4.7. </span> That is, the DES situates lifelong learning as the
highest form of adult education. It is a direct response to the information
society and its continual imposition of change in the global knowledge economy
insofar as it outlines a number of strategies to ensure adults have the
resources necessary to learn and adopt new skills and careers. Put differently,
it is an attempt to realize the dispositions ideally seeded in children through
the childhood learning established in “Ready to Learn”. In the Irish context,
lifelong learning amounts to an “upskilling” agenda rendered necessary by the
country’s economic strategy of knowledge and technology exports.</p>
<p>However, in truth, Ireland was deriving its conception of lifelong learning
from the European Union (EU). In the 1994 white paper “Growth, Competitiveness,
and Employment”, President of the European Commission, an executive body of the
EU, Jacques Delors observed the European community had long been building to a
conception of lifelong learning as a consequence of the cyclical, structural
and technological unemployment common to European economies at the time.
Delors formalized the solution as lifelong learning, “the overall objective to
which the national educational communities can make their contributions”.<label

The Challenges and Ways Forward into the 21st Century.” 1994, pgs. 11, 17.
</span> Put differently, lifelong learning is a broadly European construction
made in response to the changing world economy. Ireland’s educational and adult
learning policies, then, are situated within this context—the general policy
trends of the EU. Pepin (2007) credits the white paper for marshalling European
governments to take action for lifelong learning, stating it made educational
leaders “aware of the requirements of the knowledge-based and information
society and their consequences” and unified the once-separated concepts of
education and training.<label for="fn-2007Pepin" class="margin-toggle

From this perspective, the EU has had a drastic influence on Ireland’s
educational policy—with or without technology.</p>
