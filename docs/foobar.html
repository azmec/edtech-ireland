			<p>Competence Centres Programme from 2007 to 2010.</p>
<ul>
<li>Comprehensive government policy to ensure Ireland is at the forefront of the
“knowledge economy” or “society”.
<ul>
<li>Specific quote: “While most countries are becoming more knowledge
intensive, the challenge for Ireland is to ensure that we are at the
forefront of this transition. This Strategy shows that Ireland is serious
about committing the necessary resources to research to enable us [to]
stay with the leading pack of countries in this transition and to develop
as one of the most attractive locations for world-class researchers and
knowledge intensive enterprises.” from Mary Cryan, Chair of the Advisory
Science Council.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Possible tie-in with Royal College of Surgeons or any institutions you can
find, as this strategy in general is performed in alignment with ensuring
more postgraduate researchers are employed in enterprise and universities 
further collaborate with industry.
<ul>
<li>“Over the life of this Strategy we aim to see a doubling of postgraduate
researchers, with significant numbers of these going on to take up
employment in the enterprise sector. We also aim to ensure more effective
commercialisation of the ideas and know-how being generated in our
universities and public research institutions, and to forge new
partnerships between these institutions and enterprise.” from Foreward</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also situated in European Union’s drive to become competitive knowledge
economy</li>
<li>Competence centres situated in context of “Financial support for the
development of new technologies has come on stream in recent years but
constraints still exist to the creation of a dynamic exploitation system for
IP” between universities and enterprise (34).
<ul>
<li>Further situated in “two-pronged approach” wherein IP/Commercialisation
capabilities are strengthened and supported by sources of expertise from
EI (35).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Situated in Ireland failing to expectations; not being competitive
<ul>
<li>“For a country whose performance is so dominated by high technology
industry, there is a disjunction between this impressive overall
performance and the level of R&amp;D conducted by firms in Ireland” (38).</li>
<li>Ireland’s existing success will “curtail many conventional grant based
supports” from the European Union (40).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The good snipes:
<ul>
<li>“Industry led research needs to be supported by an appropriate
infrastructure… The closer coupling of higher education and industrial
research will differentiate Ireland as a highly attractive environment
within which to carry out advanced industrial research” (46)</li>
<li>Though IDA Ireland supports some primitive competence centres, “further
competence centres will be developed in strategically important
technologies where a clear industry need is established” (47)</li>
<li>“Enterprise Ireland, working with IDA Ireland, will have a specific
responsibility for the overall requirement of linking sources of academic
expertise with industry needs, both in the context of the development of
competence centres and HE/industry links generally.” (47)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Learnovate Technology Centre couples the demands of industry, conceived as
both workplace education, schools, and universities, and reflects the values
expressed in Irish educational technology policy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stated as much; orientation of values, Owen White <a href="https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/can-learnovate-help-your-organisation-we-sat-with-owen-white-and-peter-gillis-to-find-out/35886655.html">Donnaelly, 2017</a>:
<blockquote>
<p>We work with our members to try and identify the demand. We are trying to
make sure that what we do is meeting real demand, we help ensure that
anything our member does aligns with their customer needs to ensure that
we have the impact that is really valuable</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>The Learnovate Centre facilitated research for numerous projects now taken to
industry, the funding for which is provided by Enterprise Ireland’s
commercialisation fund.</li>
<li>For example, the Learnovate Centre developed ALPACA: an application to
assess children’s phonemic skills through a [[gamified]] experience.
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.techcentral.ie/irish-project-developing-digital-tool-for-early-literacy-screening-secures-funding/">TechCentral, 2022</a></li>
<li>In 2022, the project received €300,000 through Enterprise Ireland’s
commercialisation fund.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>See also the development of a motor skills development and assessment
platform made in collaboration with Microsoft Ireland and a university.
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>By providing a digital, gamified learning experience, it adheres to and meets
the evaluative standards for educational technology set out by related Irish
policy.</li>
<li><a href="https://archive.ph/8N6tj">This is just a cute survey of members</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://irishtechnews.ie/akari-software-becomes-learnovate-patron-member/">Akari is a member</a></li>
<li><a href="https://irishtechnews.ie/learnupon-becomes-patron-member-of-learnovate/">LearnUpon is a member</a></li>
</ul>

<li>Though, has set its sights on general workplace learning and skill
development.

<li>Reflects long-term perspective of adult learning and lifelong learning</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For example, embarked on new €400,000 project to develop a national skills
assessment platform for the workplace in collaboration with multinational
